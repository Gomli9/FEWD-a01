## Introduction

### Artist and Designer

Hello my name is **Liza**.

A little about meâ€¦ I enjoy freehand drawing. I usually work with pencil, but enjoy oil paints. I have had some of my art displayed in a couple of art shows. 

I attended a small architecture school in Los Angeles. I learned that buildings are not just a structure with rooms and there was thought and planning behind in every building. This is where I learned that my passion is architecture and design.

My interests are:
* Drawing
* Design
* Art
* Dancing

Another thing about me is that I love the city where I came from.
